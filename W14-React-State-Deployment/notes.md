Componenets state is a rpoerty dxefine d ona  class comp instance used for storing values we want to associate with it

but we are not moving onto functional components - these are used in react as a preference (become more popular than state)

react state management
most software bugs are result of bad state. more accurately bad assuptions about state. 

When wokrking withstate - be careful - use the react guidelines (not mainupatiling state yourself - use the react tools)

React Hooks are basically functions that you can use in your functional componenets

RSM 0 prevents a lot of these issues - use the state management patterns than this might help a lot with bugs wrelated to the state.

React State Flow 
- any time state changes it'll re-render as will its children/props
