# Positioning

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to use the CSS position property to change the layout of my page.

## Instructions

Fix the given code so that:

* `box 2` is positioned in the middle of `square 1` using relative positioning.
* `box 2` is positioned outside of the upper-right corner of `square 2` using absolute positioning.

Your solution must match the following image:

![Box 2 is positioned in the center of Square 1, while in Square 2, Box 2 is positioned outside the square.](./assets/image-1.png)

## 💡 Hints

How does the CSS `position` property change the document's normal flow? 
STUDENT ANSWER
The block and inline elements behave when part of the "normal flow". Boxes in the normal flow will be part of a formatting context. Either block or inliner but not both at once. Block-level boxes are described as participatin in a block formatting context and inline in an inline formatting context. All items are in-flow apart from floated items, items with position absolute (including position: fixed which acts in the same way), the foot element (html)


the CSS position function helps to arrange the items 

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is the `z-index` property? 

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
