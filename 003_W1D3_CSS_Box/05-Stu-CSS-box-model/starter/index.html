# Box Model

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to use the CSS box model properties to position four boxes inside a frame.
  
## Instructions

* Correct the code so that each box has a defined:
  * `padding` property
  * `margin` property
  * `border` property

Your solution should match the following image:
