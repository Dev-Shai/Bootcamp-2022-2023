it helps create complex and responsive single-page applications (one html file, so by clicking around it simulates changing of pages but is dynamically changing the dom etc)

Almost all UI libraries came from React inc angular and vue - open source and created by facebook

react can be scaled to build large apps

UI elements broken down into self-contained components, so they can be reused so DRY (component based)

DOM are costly in performance. So react created a virtual dom, repping the page structure in memorty and only iupdating specific things/elements.

React gives dev freedome to use JS the way they want (its not opinionated like many other frameworks)

Facebook UI - complexities. we have mulktiple updating components and interactive options. n

Why sep UI comp. Logically decompose a UI into unique part. reuse parts
● Logically decompose a UI into unique parts.
● Easily reuse these parts without rewriting code.
● Separate components are easier to test.
● Helps isolate bugs, saving time.
